Summary- 
The flights are delayed due to several reasons like due to airlines themselves or late arrival of aircrafts, weather, delay in security checks and also because of air system. Southwest airlines Co. (WN) is the most delayed flights with 19% of total airlines due to delay of aircrafts & 25.69% of total airlines by themself in the month of June. Delta airlines Inc. (DL) was most delayed airline due to security reasons and due to weather whereas American airlines Inc. (AA) was most
delayed with 12.58% of total airlines due to air system.

Design-
The line chart was chosen to showcase the trend of % total of delays with time. The color intensity shows the % total of delays with the range of high to low. The chart is interactive as any month when clicked upon shows the % of delays of airlines in that particular month.
The bar chart was a fair choice to depict the categorical variable with proportion to the variable i.e., % total delays. The color intensity displays from high to low % total delays. The bar chart is interactive in nature as when any airline is selected, the line chart shows the total % delays due to various reasons.

Summary- 
The graph shows the top 10 airports in the USA and the flights delays from origin airport and the arrival airport due to combination of all the cancellation reasons. 84,230 American airlines Inc. (AA) flights which is the most delayed airline in the year 2015 from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) from the departure airport. 90,262 Delta airlines Inc. flights in the year 2015 are the most delayed flights to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta (ATL) airport.

Design- 
The scatter plot was chosen because it is easier to depict the various airlines from the departure airport and the destination airport about the total no. of delays. The graph is interactive in nature as if we click on any airline from departure airport, we can see its arrival airport and total delay by that flight on each of the arrival airport and its same with the destination airport, we can see any flight from where it is flown and total delay from its departure airport. We can also filter the data by months as the date filter gives the freedom to choose any single or multiple months, we want to see the data. Also, the size of the dots represents the total aircrafts delay, the bigger the circle, more is the flights delays by that particular airline.

Design- 
The 3rd dashboard named Number of flights by each airline has a line chart. It is easier to depict the number of flights by each airline during each month with different color patterns representing the different airlines. The graph also depicts the total no. of flights delays of that each particular airline through the thickness of the line.
